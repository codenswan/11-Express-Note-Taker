## Description:
This application uses an express backend to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The deployed app allows the user to create and save notes, view those saved notes and deleted notes.

## Business Context
For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

## Usage:
The application is deployed at https://sleepy-ocean-15757.herokuapp.com/ 

Here are some screenshots of the application. 

This is the finished readme and a preview from vs code.
